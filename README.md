# xQTLstats

A convenient package to run X-QTL mapping in *C. elegans*. 
## Getting Started

The package is a companion to our paper on X-QTL mapping in *C. elegans*: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/27/428870
It implements the statistical method for bulk segregant analysis described in Magwene et al: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002255


### Quick start

For a comprehensive example of using xQTLstats to reproduce our mapping for Abamectin resistance, starting all the way from the sequencing fastq's on the SRA and up to the published plots, check out our [vignette](https://rpubs.com/eyalbd/738820)
